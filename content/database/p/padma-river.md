description: "This is the major river of Bangladesh that originates from the Himalaya and enters Bangladesh from India. In Bangladesh it meets with Meghna and got the name Meghna.
The total length of Ganga – Padma river system is about 2600 km. In Bangladesh, the length of Ganga is 258 km, starting with western Border of India to its confluence with Jamuna at Goalandaghat. The Padma is 126 km long, running from Goalandaghat confluence to Chandpur where it joins the Meghna.
This was a mighty one but day by day it is becoming merge. This is due to Farrakah Dam, which was set up in India."
